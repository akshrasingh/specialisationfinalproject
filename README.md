Automated Email Sentiment Analysis and Reply Generation
This project is a Flask-based web application that automates the process of analyzing email content for classification, sentiment analysis, grammar checking, and automated reply generation. It utilizes natural language processing models and libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, and LanguageTool.

Features
Email Classification: Categorizes email content into predefined categories like "Job-Related," "Personal," or "Document Checking and Editing."
Automated Reply Generation: Generates contextually appropriate replies based on the email classification.
Sentiment Analysis: Determines the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of the email content.
Grammar Checking: Highlights grammatical issues and provides corrected text.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or above
pip (Python package manager)

Setup
Model Download
This application uses the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model from Hugging Face. The model will automatically download during the first execution.

Running the Application
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Flask app:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tf_keras':

Install tf-keras with:
bash
Copy code
pip install tf-keras
RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.bert:

Ensure you have compatible versions of TensorFlow and Keras installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow==2.11.0 keras==2.11.0
Model Download Slow or Interrupted:

Ensure a stable internet connection as the model size is ~669 MB.
Future Enhancements
Add more categories for email classification.
Enable multilingual support for non-English emails.
Deploy the application using a production-ready server (e.g., Gunicorn) or on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
